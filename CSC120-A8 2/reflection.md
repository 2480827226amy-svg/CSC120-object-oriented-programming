Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the Cafe class, the constructor is overloaded, in order to make the program run smoothly even there are not corresponding values for the input parameters. We choose to set the parameters to default values. 

The sellCoffee method is overloaded as well, because consumers do not always order for specific amount of sugar packets and creams. To ensure the program runs, we will set the default amount of sugar packets and creams. 

The restock method is overloaded to ensure that even if the barista do not enter the specific amount refilled, the program sets the restock value to maximum automatically.

The shopOptions method is overloaded to add additional methods specific to cafe class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would advice starting by understanding what overriding and overloading means in Java. And then, start with the constructor of cafe class and experiment with adding or removing parameters in the input, which can help students gain a practical idea of how to overload a code chunk. 

We spent a lot of time figuring out how to start. From the classes, we understood what override and overload basically means, but when writing the codes, we found it hard to start. Therefore, a piece of advice I would give to future students is to start by reviewing in class examples.
