- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My initial impression is that, it makes coding more efficient. I didn’t have to rewrite the same codes in each subclass with the use of Inheritance. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
In my code, I used super() to call the constructor, and it was interesting to see how all my classes followed the same pattern. What didn’t work at first was managing the relationships between thees subclasses and I also mixed up method names like put, remove, contains, containsKey in Hashtable, but after debugging the code works.

My advice is to start doing homework early so you can have more taim understanding inheritance in practice.
